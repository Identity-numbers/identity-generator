# identity-generator

An identity number generator. 
Created by Linus Jarbo and Hugo Angulo 2020

# About

In this program it is possible to generate a single identity number for an integer sequence. 
(but it is also possible to generate a recursive sequence of the single identity number)

The single identity number is found vertically as a repeating pattern in the repeated folding
of a sequence of integers. It repeats itself throughout the folding.

See the blue rectangle in the image below.

A single fold takes the integer, viewed as a positional container (updatable value) from the lowest contrasting value, to it's highest.

# Bugs
- Copy to memory doesn't seem to work in webgl format? Does work in editor.

# Feature Requests
- save text to file
- add a strict recursive output so it can be used in mathematica(?)

# Updates, log
version 1.2

- use a font without kerning(spacing) suited for mathematics and readabillity
- Added recursive identity calculation at set number of iterations
- verbose toggle
